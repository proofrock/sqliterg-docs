# ðŸ”§ Installation

`sqliterg` is distributed as a single executable file. Head to the [releases](https://github.com/proofrock/sqliterg/releases) page on GitHub, and download the compressed file relevant for your OS and architecture; see in the page on [builds](../../building-and-testing.md) whether to use bundled or dynamic builds. Then, extract it with a compatible client. You can run it straight away.

`sqliterg` deals only with:

* Database files;
* YAML configuration files;
* backups.

It doesn't create or access any other file.

If there are no files for your OS/arch, look into [building it yourself](../../building-and-testing.md).
