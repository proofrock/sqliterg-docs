# ðŸ”§ Installation

Installation consists of a single executable file. Head to the [releases](https://github.com/proofrock/sqliterg/releases) page on GitHub, and download the compressed file relevant for your OS and architecture; see in the page on [builds](../../building-and-testing.md) whether to use bundled or dynamic builds. Then, extract it with a compatible client.

If there are no files for your OS/arch, look into [building it yourself](../../building-and-testing.md).

Either way, you'll have a single binary. Take it to the [running](../running.md) stage.
