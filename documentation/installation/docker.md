# üê≥ Docker

`sqliterg` provides a [standard Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/germanorizzo/sqliterg), based on `alpine:latest`. It's a multiarch image for `x86_64` and `aarch64`, [dynamically](../../building-and-testing.md#types-of-binaries) compiled.

Here are the relevant configurations:

|                |                                 |                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Exposed port   | 12321                           | Fixed; remap it with `-p`               |
| Config dir     | `/data`                         | Fixed; remap it with `-v`               |
| User to run as | `--user <user_id>[:<group_id>]` | Docker standard switch; _**do use it**_ |
| Timezone       | `-e TZ=xxx/yyy`                 | Docker standard env var                 |

#### Example

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
docker run -d \
 --restart=unless-stopped \
 --name=sqliterg \
 -p 8080:12321 \
 -v /mnt/DockerHome/myDir:/data \
 --user 1000:1001 \
 -e TZ=Europe/Rome \
 germanorizzo/sqliterg:latest \
 --db /data/testDb.db
```
{% endcode %}

This command will install and run `sqliterg`, configuring it to:

* Use port 8080 (Line 4);
* Map a local dir to path `/data` in the docker environment (Line 5);
* Starts `sqliterg` as user 1000, group 1001 (Line 6);
* Sets the time zone (Line 7);
* Use free cli arguments, as it was the `sqliterg` binary (Line 9).

The rest of the lines in this example are standard Docker.

#### Important

* It's important to use `--user`, otherwise `sqliterg` will start with root privileges! You don't want this, as it creates files; for example, backups may potentially overwrite some file or wreak havoc in unpredictable ways (which are actually very predictable, but only after they happen).

#### Caveats

* You have to reference database and companion files that are in the directory mapped to `/data` as they were in `/data`;
* The path for the database file should be absolute, i.e. `/data/...`.
