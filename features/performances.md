# ðŸš„ Performances

The target `make profile` executes performance tests, absolute and against the latest `ws4sqlite` binary.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
A recent Java JDK is necessary, and currently the scripts are for UNIX and x86\_64
{% endhint %}

The profiler submits 20'000 calls to the server, with each call covering pretty much all the various features.&#x20;

See below for the call JSON. It's 8 calls, of which 2 `SELECT`s reading values and 6 modifying them.

This is a performance profile for a "bundled" build:

```
sqliterg v0.17.0. based on SQLite v3.41.2
...
Elapsed seconds in sqliterg: 46.325
```

\=> **0.29ms** per call

This is for a "dynamic" build:

```
sqliterg v0.17.0. based on SQLite v3.41.2
...
Elapsed seconds in sqliterg: 25.999
```

\=> **0.16ms** per call

The baseline `ws4sqlite` numbers are:

```
ws4sqlite v0.15.0, based on sqlite v3.41.2
...
Elapsed seconds in ws4sqlite: 52.702
```

Test was made on a 2-core, 4-threads `i3-1115G4 @ 3.00GHz`.
