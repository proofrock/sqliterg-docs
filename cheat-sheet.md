    --port 12321 \                # Optional

## Configuration file

This is taken from `db_conf.template.yaml` in the repository.

```yaml
# Main endpoint for requests is http://<host>:<port>/<db_name>

# If present, "auth" defines the authentication for this database
auth:
  # Optional, by default 401. The error HTTP code to be returned if auth fails.
  authErrorCode: 499
  # Mandatory. Defines how the credentials are passed to the server.
  #   "INLINE" means that credentials are passed in the request
  #   "HTTP_BASIC" uses Basic Authentication (via the "Authorization: Basic" header)
  mode: INLINE
  # Only one among "byQuery" and "byCredentials" must be specified.
  # This query validates credentials against a query in the database, it must have
  #   two parameters named ":user" and ":password" and if the credentials are valid must
  #   return (at least) one row.
  byQuery: SELECT 1 FROM AUTH WHERE USER = :user AND PASS = :password
  # This is a list of valid credentials, "statically" specified. "user" is case-insensitive
  #   while either a plaintext "password" or a SHA-256 hashed "hashedPassword" must be supplied.
  byCredentials:
    - user: myUser1
      password: ciao
    - user: myUser2
      hashedPassword: b133a0c0e9bee3be20163d2ad31d6248db292aa6dcb1ee087a2aa50e0fc75ae2 # "ciao"
# Journal mode for the database. Optional, default is "WAL". Not validated to accommodate for
#   future versions of SQLite. From SQLite docs: DELETE | TRUNCATE | PERSIST | MEMORY | WAL | OFF
journalMode: WAL
# Database is read-only. This is set after startup macros or backup are performed, so they can
#   still modify the database. It's implemented using the query_only PRAGMA.
readOnly: false
# Instruct the web server to povide the CORS header and preflight system as needed.
corsOrigin: "*"
# A "map" of statements (or queries) that can be called from request or macros using '^'. If I
#   want to use Q1, for example, I should specify '"query": "^Q1"' in the request.
storedStatements:

    sql: SELECT * FROM TBL
  - id: Q2

#   creation, at startup, every /n/ minutes, or via a web request.

    execution:
      # Executes if the database is created (file wasn't present or in-memory)
      onCreate: false
      # Executes at each startup. Implies onCreate; if both are specified the macro will be executed once.
      onStartup: false
      # Executes every /n/ minutes. First execution is /n/ minutes after startup.
      period: 1 # in minutes, <= 0: never
      # Exposes an endpoint to execute the macro. A token-based for of authentication is mandatory.
      # Endpoint is http://<host>:<port>/<db_name>/macro/<macro_id>
      webService:
        # Optional, by default 401. The error HTTP code to be returned if auth fails.
        authErrorCode: 499

backup:
  # Directory for the backups. Must exist; mandatory config.
